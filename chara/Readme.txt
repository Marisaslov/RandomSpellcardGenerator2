README

Want to contribute? Here's the structure of the files!
Firstly, you cannot have lines with nothing in them.
# marks a full-line comment; the octothrope must be at the beginning of the line
:sign, :adj, :noun, :noun2, and :formatter are followed by phrases, one per line.
Spell structure in general is 'sign: adj noun' or 'sign: noun of noun2'
Formatters use underscores for parts that are replaced by random phrases.

For each major category (Touhou Canon, Touhou Fanon, etc), please use a separate sign:, etc. Also, you MUST have one entry for each category except :formatter, or there will be errors.

All you need to do is send a pull request, and add the character into the main README.md and the manifest.txt in the correct position.

Note on citing sources:
When citing interesting or creative spellcard name components from scripts, # <Scripter's name> <Name of boss(es)> right above. See Yuuka.txt for an example

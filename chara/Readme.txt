README

Want to contribute? Here's the structure of the files!
Firstly, you cannot have lines with nothing in them.
# marks a full-line comment
:sign, :adj, :noun, and :noun2 are followed by phrases, one per line.
Spell structure in general is 'sign: adj noun' or 'sign: noun of noun2'

For each major category (Touhou Canon, Touhou Fanon, etc), please use a separate sign:, etc. Also, you MUST have one entry for each of the :adj, etc, or there will be errors.

All you need to do is send a pull request, and add the character into the main README.md and the manifest.txt in the correct position.
